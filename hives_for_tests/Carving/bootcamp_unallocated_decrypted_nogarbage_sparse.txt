1. This is unallocated space extracted from a bootcamp volume of a modern Mac laptop (with the T2 chip present).
2. The operating system installed in this volume is Windows 10 "20H1", the file system used is NTFS, this file system is BitLocker-encrypted.
3. The Trim support was left as is (enabled).
4. The operating system was used for some time.
5. The volume was decrypted (into an image file) using the 'dislocker' tool (an unreleased development version).
6. After decryption, garbage blocks (blocks filled with null bytes in their "encrypted" state, they are "decrypted" into random data, such blocks originate from the Trim command) were zeroed out in the decrypted image.
7. Then, unallocated space was extracted using the 'blkls' tool (The Sleuth Kit).
8. Finally, null blocks (in the decrypted state of the unallocated space) were converted into sparse ranges. And the unallocate space was compressed into the TGZ archive.
9. You can find registry and other data in such unallocated space. For example (Windows 10 Timeline):
